# SalvageMode
Building app that uses cityIQ sensors to find disaster victims and optimize emergency response routes. We use pedestrian speed data with image recognition to pinpoint non-moving bodies and create routes to them using carpooling algorithm.
Work in progress. Backend using nodejs, Routing script using or-tools and numpy. Partner Cris Zong wrote the figure detection script using OpenCV
